# [TBA]
A simple sass mixin library for animations and transitions.

## Getting Started
[TBA] has been written to be easy to use. The mixins have been written using SCSS, but the intention has always been to stay as close to CSS as possible, while leverging the benefits of modularized mixins, each with their own arguments, in order to lend more user customization.

### Requirements
Sass 3.2+

### Installing

## Browser Support
[TBA] uses CSS3 transform, keyframes, animations and transitions, so it's really only for modern browsers. Visit http://caniuse.com/ for a clear idea of CSS3 browser support.

All the mixins compile down to vendor prefixed CSS, and have been tested on the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Opera. I aim to do more browser testing and hope to increase compatability, especially for IE.
